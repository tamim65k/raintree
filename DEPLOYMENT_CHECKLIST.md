   ```

2. **Upload `client/dist` folder** to your hosting service

3. **Configure environment variables** in your hosting dashboard

4. **Ensure SPA routing** is configured (redirect all routes to index.html)

## Post-Deployment Checklist

### Functionality Test
- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] Can access the application
- [ ] User system button works
- [ ] Can create new account
- [ ] Can login with existing account
- [ ] Can create a plan
- [ ] Can view dashboard
- [ ] Can add progress to plan
- [ ] Charts render correctly
- [ ] Notifications appear
- [ ] Can logout and login again

### Performance Test

- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Images/assets load correctly
- [ ] Smooth animations
- [ ] Responsive on different screen sizes

### Mobile Test

- [ ] Touch controls work
- [ ] Readable text sizes
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling

### Security Check
- [ ] Environment variables not exposed in client code
- [ ] `.env` file not in repository
- [ ] Supabase credentials secure
- [ ] No sensitive data in console logs

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Node.js version (16+)
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
- Run `npm install` again
- Try `npm run build` again

### App Loads but Login Fails
- Verify Supabase credentials in environment variables
- Check Supabase project is active (not paused)
- Verify SQL setup was run correctly
- Check browser console for errors

### Plans Not Saving
- Check Supabase connection
- Verify tables exist in Supabase dashboard
- Check RLS policies are active
- Review browser console for errors

### IP Lookup Not Working
- This is expected in production
- IP lookup works in development mode
- Can be safely ignored or disabled

## Monitoring

### After Deployment
- Monitor Supabase dashboard for:
  - Database usage
  - API requests
  - Error logs
  - User activity

### Analytics (Optional)
Consider adding:
- Google Analytics
- Plausible Analytics
- Vercel Analytics
- Custom logging

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor Supabase usage (free tier limits)
- Check for security updates
- Update dependencies monthly
- Backup database data

### Scaling Considerations
- Free tier limits:
  - Supabase: 500MB database, 50MB file storage
