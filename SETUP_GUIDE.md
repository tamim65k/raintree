2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy and paste the entire content of `SUPABASE_SETUP.sql`
4. Click "Run" or press Ctrl+Enter
5. You should see "Success. No rows returned"

The script creates:

```

**Note**: The `.env` file should be in the `client` folder, not the root.

### Alternative: Netlify, Railway, etc.

The app can be deployed to any static hosting platform:

1. Build the app: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `client/dist` folder
3. Set environment variables in your platform's dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch IP information" Error

This is expected in production if the IP API is rate-limited. The IP lookup feature works in development with the Vite middleware. For production, you may need to:
- Use a different IP API
- Set up your own backend API
- Or simply ignore this feature if not needed

### Supabase Connection Issues

1. Check your `.env` file is in the `client` folder
2. Verify the credentials are correct
3. Make sure you ran the SQL setup script
4. Check Supabase project is active (not paused)

### Login Not Working

1. Verify the `users` table exists in Supabase
2. Check RLS policies are created
3. Try creating a new account
4. Check browser console for errors

### Plans Not Showing

1. Verify the `plans` table exists
2. Check you're logged in with the correct user
3. Try creating a new plan
4. Check Supabase logs in the dashboard
