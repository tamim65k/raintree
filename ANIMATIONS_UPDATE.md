# 🎨 Advanced Hacking Animations Update

## ✅ What's New

### 1. 🔀 **Individual Window Glitches**

**Before:** Global glitch affected entire screen
**Now:** Each window glitches independently at random times

**Features:**
- Random window selection for glitch effect
- Different timing for each window (800-2000ms intervals)
- Short glitch duration (150-300ms)
- No glitches when dashboard is open
- Creates more dynamic, realistic hacking aesthetic

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Each window now has its own glitch state
{ id, visible, glitch: false }

// Random window glitches every 0.8-2 seconds
const glitchRandomWindow = () => {
    const randomWindow = visibleWindows[random]
    setWins(prev => prev.map(w => 
        w.id === randomWindow.id ? { ...w, glitch: true } : w
    ))
}
```

✅ **Mobile Optimization**
- All background animations hidden on mobile
- Only scan lines remain (reduced opacity)
- Popups responsive (90% width on mobile)
- Saves battery and improves performance

✅ **Z-Index Management**
- Background animations: z-index 1
- Scan lines: z-index 2
- Windows: z-index 100-2000
- Popups: z-index 9999

### Animation Timing

| Animation | Interval | Duration |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Window Glitch | 0.8-2s | 150-300ms |
| Hacking Popup | 4-6s (~5s avg) | 3-5s |
| Matrix Rain | Continuous | 10-20s per column |
| Scan Lines | Continuous | 8-12s per line |
| Code Stream | Continuous | 2s per message |
| Hexagons | Continuous | 15-25s rotation |
| Binary Stream | Continuous | 15s fall |
| Circuit Lines | Continuous | 8s pulse |
| Data Packets | Continuous | 5-10s travel |

## 🔧 Customization Options

Want to adjust the animations? Here's how:

### Change Popup Frequency
```javascript
// In App.jsx, line ~705
const interval = setInterval(createHackingPopup, 
    4000 + Math.random() * 2000  // Change these values (currently 4-6s)
)
```

### Change Glitch Frequency
```javascript
// In App.jsx, line ~534
const interval = setInterval(glitchRandomWindow, 
    800 + Math.random() * 1200  // Change these values
)
```

### Adjust Animation Opacity
```css
/* In styles.css */
.matrix-rain { opacity: 0.15; }  /* Change this */
.binary-stream-bg { opacity: 0.08; }  /* Change this */
.circuit-board { opacity: 0.15; }  /* Change this */
```

### Disable Specific Animations
```javascript
// In App.jsx, comment out unwanted animations:
// <MatrixRain />
// <BinaryStream />
// <CircuitBoard />
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Popups Not Appearing
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure dashboard is closed (popups pause when open)
- First popup appears after 2 seconds
- Then every 4-6 seconds
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Performance Issues
- Disable some background animations
- Reduce animation opacity
- Check if running on mobile (auto-optimized)

### Glitches Too Frequent
- Increase interval in glitchRandomWindow function
- Reduce glitch duration
