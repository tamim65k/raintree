# Mobile Design Fixes - RAINTREE.WIKI

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Logo Window Content Not Fully Visible
**Problem:** Logo window height was only 200px on mobile, causing content to be cut off or cramped.

**Solution:**
- Increased logo window height from 200px to 280px on mobile
- Added `min-height: 100%` to `.logo-content` to ensure full height usage
- Added `flex-shrink: 0` to logo elements to prevent compression
- Adjusted logo SVG size to 70px × 70px (optimized for space)
- Reduced title font to 17px with 1.5px letter-spacing
- Optimized padding and gaps (15px padding, 12px gap)
- Reduced binary rain opacity to 0.4 for less distraction
- Ensured button is fully visible with proper spacing

**Result:** All logo window content (logo, title, button, binary rain) now displays properly on mobile screens.

### 2. Large Gap Between IP Terminal and Network Scanner
**Problem:** There was a large gap between the IP Terminal and Network Scanner windows because the User Dashboard window was positioned in between them in the layout order.

**Solution:**
- Refactored mobile layout calculation to use a `currentY` variable
- Windows now stack sequentially with consistent 10px gaps
- Order maintained: Logo → IP Terminal → User Dashboard → Network Scanner → Other Terminals
- Eliminated calculation errors that caused inconsistent spacing

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before: Fixed calculations with potential gaps
const winHeight = Math.max(250, windowHeight * 0.3)
data = [
    { id: 6, x: 10, y: 10, h: 200 },
    { id: 5, x: 10, y: 220, h: winHeight },
    { id: 7, x: 10, y: 220 + winHeight + 10, h: winHeight },
    { id: 1, x: 10, y: 220 + (winHeight + 10) * 2, h: winHeight },
    // ...
]

// After: Dynamic calculation with consistent gaps
const logoHeight = 280
const gap = 10
let currentY = 10

data = [
    { id: 6, x: 10, y: currentY, h: logoHeight },
]
currentY += logoHeight + gap

data.push({ id: 5, x: 10, y: currentY, h: winHeight })
currentY += winHeight + gap

data.push({ id: 7, x: 10, y: currentY, h: winHeight })
currentY += winHeight + gap
// ... continues for all windows
```

**Result:** All windows now have consistent 10px gaps between them, creating a smooth vertical flow.

## Mobile Window Order (Top to Bottom)

1. **RAINTREE.WIKI** (280px height)
2. **IP LOOKUP TERMINAL** (dynamic height, min 250px)
3. **USER DASHBOARD** (dynamic height, min 250px)
4. **NETWORK SCANNER** (dynamic height, min 250px)
5. **EXPLOIT FRAMEWORK** (dynamic height, min 250px)
6. **NETWORK MONITOR** (dynamic height, min 250px)
7. **SYSTEM MONITOR** (dynamic height, min 250px)

All windows have 10px gaps between them.

## Additional Improvements Made

### Logo Window Optimizations:
- **SVG Size:** 70px × 70px (balanced for mobile)
- **Title:** 17px font, 1.5px letter-spacing
- **Button:** 14px padding, max-width 280px
- **Binary Rain:** Reduced opacity to 0.4, smaller digits (12px)
- **Layout:** Centered content with proper spacing

### Layout System:
- **Dynamic Positioning:** Uses `currentY` variable for accurate stacking
- **Consistent Gaps:** 10px between all windows
- **Flexible Heights:** Windows adapt to screen size (min 250px, max 30% of viewport)
- **Proper Margins:** 10px from screen edges
