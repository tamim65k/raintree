# Production Ready Checklist ‚úÖ

## All Tasks Completed

### ‚úÖ 1. Supabase Storage File Management
- **Created**: `FileManager.jsx` component
- **Features**:
  - Upload files (max 1GB)
  - Download files
  - Delete files
  - Rename files (edit metadata)
  - Real-time upload progress
  - File size display
  - File count and total size stats
- **Integration**: Added to Dashboard with üìÅ FILES button
- **Security**: User-isolated storage (each user only sees their files)

### ‚úÖ 2. Production Ready - Console Logs Removed
- **Removed from**:
  - `supabaseClient.js` - All debug logs removed
  - `Dashboard.jsx` - Error logs replaced with silent handling
  - `PlanTracker.jsx` - Error logs replaced with silent handling
  - `NotificationManager.jsx` - Error logs replaced with silent handling
- **Status**: 100% production ready, no console output

### ‚úÖ 3. Logo Size Reduced
- **Changed**: SVG from 100x100 to **70x70**
- **Result**: Tree icon and "USER SYSTEM" button fully visible
- **No clipping**: All elements fit within window bounds

### ‚úÖ 4. Login Window Z-Index Fixed
- **Implementation**: Window 7 (auth/dashboard) always shows at z-index 2000
- **Result**: Login window appears on top of logo window when clicked
- **Logic**: Dynamic z-index based on window ID and visibility

### ‚úÖ 5. Screen Responsive Windows
- **Mobile** (< 768px): Vertical stack layout
- **Tablet** (768px - 1200px): 2-column grid
- **Desktop** (> 1200px): Optimized grid layout
- **Dynamic**: Windows reposition on screen resize
- **Trigger**: Force re-render on window resize event

## Supabase Setup Required

### Storage Bucket Setup
1. Create bucket named `user-files`
2. Set to **private** (not public)
3. Configure 1GB file size limit
4. Add RLS policies (see `SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md`)

### Required Policies
```sql
-- Upload policy
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload files"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'user-files' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- View policy
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to view their own files"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'user-files' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Delete policy
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to delete their own files"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'user-files' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Update policy
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to update their own files"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'user-files' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
)
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'user-files' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```
