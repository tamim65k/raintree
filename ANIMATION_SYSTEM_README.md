### 3. **App.jsx Updates**

#### Changes:
- Imported animation components from `HackingAnimations.jsx`
- Removed duplicate animation code (moved to HackingAnimations.jsx)
- Added animation toggle state management
- Implemented event listener for animation toggle from Dashboard
- Replaced individual animation components with `AnimationContainer`
- Animation state persists across sessions via localStorage

---

### 4. **Dashboard.jsx Updates**

#### New State Variables:
```javascript
const [showFileManager, setShowFileManager] = useState(false)
const [showNotifications, setShowNotifications] = useState(false)
const [showAnimationSettings, setShowAnimationSettings] = useState(false)
const [animationsEnabled, setAnimationsEnabled] = useState(() => {
    const saved = localStorage.getItem('animations_enabled')
    return saved !== null ? JSON.parse(saved) : true
})
```

#### New Functions:
- `toggleAnimations()` - Toggles animation state and dispatches event to App.jsx

#### New UI Sections:
1. File Manager view
2. Notification Manager view
3. Animation Settings view

---

## How It Works

### Notification System
1. **Automatic Checking**: Runs every 60 seconds
2. **Plan Monitoring**: 
   - Checks if plans have been updated today
   - Checks if plans are ending soon (within 3 days)
3. **Notification Display**:
   - Shows count of active notifications
   - Color-coded by type (warning/reminder)
   - Dismissible notifications
4. **Settings**: User can enable/disable different notification types

### Animation Toggle System
1. **User Action**: User clicks "🎨 ANIMATIONS" button in Dashboard
2. **Settings View**: Shows toggle switch and list of animations
3. **Toggle Action**: 
   - Updates local state
   - Saves to localStorage
   - Dispatches custom event `animationsToggle`
4. **App.jsx Listener**: Receives event and updates animation state
5. **AnimationContainer**: Conditionally renders based on `enabled` prop
6. **Persistence**: Setting persists across browser sessions

### File Manager System
1. **Upload**: Select file → Upload to Supabase Storage
2. **Download**: Click download → File downloads to device
3. **Rename**: Click rename → Enter new name → Save
4. **Delete**: Click delete → Confirm → File removed
5. **Storage**: Files stored in user-specific folders in Supabase

```
client/src/
├── App.jsx                      (Main app, animation toggle listener)
├── Dashboard.jsx                (Dashboard with new features)
├── FileManager.jsx              (File CRUD operations)

## Usage

### For Users:

1. **Access File Manager**:
   - Open Dashboard → Click "📁 FILE" button
   - Upload, download, rename, or delete files

2. **Check Notifications**:
   - Open Dashboard → Click "🔔 NOTIFICATIONS" button
   - View active notifications
   - Configure notification settings

3. **Control Animations**:
   - Open Dashboard → Click "🎨 ANIMATIONS" button
   - Toggle animations on/off
   - View list of available animations

### For Developers:

1. **Add New Animation**:
   ```javascript
   // In HackingAnimations.jsx
   export const MyNewAnimation = memo(() => {
       // Animation logic here
       return <div className="my-animation">...</div>
   })
   
   // Add to AnimationContainer
   export const AnimationContainer = memo(({ enabled }) => {
       if (!enabled) return null
       return (
           <>
               {/* ... existing animations ... */}
               <MyNewAnimation />
           </>
       )
   })
   ```

2. **Use Animation Components**:
   ```javascript
   import { MatrixRain, ScanLines } from './HackingAnimations'
   
   function MyComponent() {
       return (
           <>
               <MatrixRain />
               <ScanLines />
           </>
       )
   }
   ```

## Performance Considerations

- All animations are memoized using `React.memo()`
- Animations can be disabled for better performance
- Animation state is managed efficiently
- No unnecessary re-renders
- localStorage prevents animation flicker on page load

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Individual animation toggles (not just all on/off)
2. Animation speed controls
3. Custom animation themes
4. Email notifications via Supabase triggers
5. Push notifications for mobile
6. File sharing between users
7. File preview functionality
8. Bulk file operations

---

## Testing

### Test Notification System:
1. Create a plan
2. Wait for notifications to appear (checks every minute)
3. Verify daily reminders work
4. Verify ending soon warnings work
5. Test notification dismissal
6. Test settings toggles

### Test Animation Toggle:
1. Open Dashboard → Animations
2. Toggle animations off
3. Verify all animations stop
4. Refresh page
5. Verify setting persists
6. Toggle animations on
7. Verify all animations resume

### Test File Manager:
1. Upload a file
2. Download the file
3. Rename the file
4. Delete the file
5. Verify all operations work correctly
